- Problem Patterns

---

### ✅ Sliding Window & Two Pointer
> Learn optimal subarray/subsequence techniques using these two powerful patterns.

---

### ✅ Heaps (Priority Queue)
> From heap basics to max/min heaps and problem-solving using Java’s PriorityQueue.

---

### ✅ Greedy Algorithms
> Explore intuitive and efficient greedy strategies with common tricks.

---

### ✅ Binary Trees
> Build strong intuition for tree traversals and problem-solving techniques.

- BFS / DFS
- Medium and Hard LeetCode-level problems

---

### ✅ Binary Search Trees (BST)
> Learn insertion, deletion, and problem patterns with real-world examples.

---

### ✅ Graphs
> Grasp core graph algorithms including:

- DFS / BFS
- Dijkstra’s, Topological Sort
- Cycle Detection, Union-Find

---

### ✅ Dynamic Programming (DP)
> Tame DP through patterns and tabulation/memoization strategies.
